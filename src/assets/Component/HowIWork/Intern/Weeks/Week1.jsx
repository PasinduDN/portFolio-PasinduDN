            <p>This week marked my first experience in the office, filled with learning opportunities and exciting beginnings. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how my first week unfolded.</p> 
            <ul>
                <li> <h6>Joining the Team : </h6> On my first day, I was warmly welcomed into the team. I was introduced to an Associate Software Engineer who would be my mentor. The project manager gave me an overview of the team and the project we are working on, setting the stage for an enriching learning experience.</li>
                <li> <h6>Simple Student Management System: : </h6> During the initial days, my mentor assigned me a task to create a Simple Student Management System using CRUD operations. This task was pivotal in helping me understand the fundamentals of our project framework and how to carry out work efficiently. </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li> <h6> Learning Stored Procedures :</h6> After completing the student management system, my mentor introduced me to stored procedures. This was a new concept for me, and understanding how to implement them effectively posed a challenge. However, with my mentor's guidance, I was able to grasp the basics and apply them in our project. This experience highlighted the importance of database management and optimized data handling in software development. </li>
            </ul>

                <li> <h6> Understanding Project Architecture :</h6> One of the most valuable lessons this week was understanding the relationship between the controller, service, and model in our project. My mentor demonstrated how these components interact within our codebase, which was enlightening. I learned how to navigate through the project structure, and how each part plays a crucial role in the overall functionality. </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li> <h6> Deepening Technical Skills :</h6> Moving forward, I aim to deepen my understanding of stored procedures and their application. Additionally, I plan to explore more about the intricacies of the MVC architecture and how to leverage it for efficient project development. </li>
                <li> <h6> Building Relationships: </h6> Another goal is to build stronger relationships within my team. Establishing good communication and collaboration is key to our collective success. </li>
